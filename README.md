# Samsung-Data-Project

The aim of the project is to collect, work and clean the data from 30 volunteers who performed 6 different activities.
Every individual wore a Samsung Galaxy on the waist while Walking, Walking_upstairs, Walking_downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying.

The raw data was captured from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope. It was organized in two differents datasets (train and test sets) with separate labels and subjects. 70% of individuals contribute to complete the train set and the rest 30% fullfill the test set.

Both data sets were merged in a single dataframe including its corresponding labels and subjects (individuals performing the activity). 
Measurements on the mean and standard deviations variables were selected from each measurement.
Train and test labels were named according to the activity labels document.
